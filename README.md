  <h1>News Application</h1>
  <p>
Deployed site: https://dz-nc-news.netlify.app/. Please be aware that it may take a minute or so to load initially as the server starts up on Render.

This project is a social news platform where users can browse articles organized by topics, rate them, and post comments. I developed the API (available here) to manage the backend logic, facilitating smooth CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The application is built with React, allowing users to add, edit, and manage articles and comments.</p>
