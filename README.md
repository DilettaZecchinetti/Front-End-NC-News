NC News Application
Deployed site: https://dz-nc-news.netlify.app/. Please note, it may take a minute or so to initially load as the the server spins up on Render.

This project is a social news platform where users can explore articles categorized by topics, rate them, and leave comments. I built the API (find it here) to handle the backend logic, enabling seamless interaction for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The application itself is developed using React. It allows users to add, edit, and manage articles and comments.
